			<p>When we arrived upon the highest summit of Mont Pelvoux, in Dauphiné, in <time datetime="1861">1861</time>, we saw, to our surprise and disappointment, that it was not the culminating point of the district; and that another mountain⁠—distant about a couple of miles, and separated from us by an impassable gulf⁠—claimed that distinction. I was troubled in spirit about this mountain, and my thoughts often reverted to the great wall-sided peak, second in apparent inaccessibility only to the Matterhorn.</p>
			<p>The year <time datetime="1862">1862</time> passed away without a chance of getting to it, and my holiday was too brief in <time datetime="1863">1863</time> even to think about it; but in the following year it was possible, and I resolved to set my mind at rest by completing the task which had been left unfinished in <time datetime="1861">1861</time>.</p>
			<p>In the meantime others had turned their attention to Dauphiné. First of all (in <time datetime="1862">1862</time>) came <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">F.</abbr> Tuckett⁠—that mighty mountaineer, whose name is known throughout the length and breadth of the Alps⁠—with the guides Michel Croz, Peter Perrn, and Bartolommeo Peyrotte, and great success attended his arms. But <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Tuckett halted before the Pointe des Écrins, and, dismayed by its appearance, withdrew his forces to gather less dangerous laurels elsewhere.</p>
			<p>His expedition, however, threw some light upon the Écrins. He pointed out the direction from which an attack was most likely to be successful, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> William Mathews and the <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T. G.</abbr> Bonney (to whom he communicated the result of his labours) attempted to execute the ascent, with the brothers Michel and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. B.</abbr> Croz, by following his indications. But they too were defeated, as I shall relate more particularly presently.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>The guide Michel Croz had thus been engaged in both of these expeditions in Dauphiné, and I naturally looked to him for assistance. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mathews (to whom I applied for information) gave him a high character, and concluded his reply to me by saying that Croz “was only happy when upwards of 10,000 feet high.”</p>
			<p>I know what my friend meant. Croz was happiest when he was employing his powers to the utmost. Places where you and I would “toil and sweat, and yet be freezing cold,” were bagatelles to him, and it was only when he got above the range of ordinary mortals, and was required to employ his magnificent strength, and to draw upon his unsurpassed knowledge of ice and snow, that he could be said to be really and truly happy.</p>
			<p>Of all the guides with whom I travelled, Michel Croz was the man who was most after my own heart. He did not work like a blunt razor, and take to his toil unkindly. He did not need urging, or to be told a second time to do anything. You had only to say <em>what</em> was to be done, and <em>how</em> it was to be done, and the work <em>was</em> done, if it was possible. Such men are not common, and when they are known they are valued. Michel was not widely known, but those who did know him came again and again. The inscription that is placed upon his tomb truthfully records that he was “beloved by his comrades and esteemed by travellers.”</p>
			<p>At the time that I was planning my journey, my friends, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Messrs.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A. W.</abbr> Moore and Horace Walker were also drawing up their programme; and, as we found that our wishes were very similar, we agreed to unite our respective parties. The excursions which are described in this and the two following chapters are mutual ideas which were jointly executed.</p>
			<p>Our united programme was framed so as to avoid sleeping in inns, and so that we should see from the highest point attained on one day, a considerable portion of the route which was intended to be followed on the next. This latter matter was an important one to us, as all of our projected excursions were new ones, and led over ground about which there was very little information in print.</p>
			<p>My friends had happily secured Christian Almer of Grindelwald as their guide. The combination of Croz and Almer was a perfect one. Both men were in the prime of life;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-127" id="noteref-127" epub:type="noteref">127</a> both were endued with strength and activity far beyond the average; and the courage and the knowledge of each was alike undoubted. The temper of Almer it was impossible to ruffle; he was ever obliging and enduring⁠—a bold but a safe man. That which he lacked in fire⁠—in dash⁠—was supplied by Croz, who, in his turn, was kept in place by Almer. It is pleasant to remember how they worked together, and how each one confided to you that he liked the other <em>so</em> much because he worked <em>so</em> well; but it is sad, very sad, to those who have known the men, to know that they can never work together again.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p id="chapter-8-p-12">We met at <abbr>St.</abbr> Michel on the Mont Cenis road, at midday on <time datetime="1864-06-20">June 20, 1864</time>, and proceeded in the afternoon over the Col de Valloires to the village of the same name. The summit of this pretty little pass is about 3,500 feet above <abbr>St.</abbr> Michel, and from it we had a fair view of the Aiguilles d’Arve, a group of three peaks of singular form, which it was our especial object to investigate.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-128" id="noteref-128" epub:type="noteref">128</a> They had been seen by ourselves and others from numerous distant points, and always looked very high and very inaccessible; and we had been unable to obtain any information about them, except the few words in Joanne’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Itinéraire du Dauphiné</i>. Having made out from the summit of the Col de Valloires that they could be approached from the Valley of Valloires, we hastened down to find a place where we could pass the night, as near as possible to the entrance of the little valley leading up to them.</p>
			<p>By nightfall we arrived at the entrance to this little valley (Vallon des Aiguilles d’Arve), and found some buildings placed just where they were wanted. The proprietress received us with civility, and placed a large barn at our disposal, on the conditions that no lights were struck or pipes smoked therein; and when her terms were agreed to, she took us into her own chalet, made up a huge fire, heated a gallon of milk, and treated us with genuine hospitality.</p>
			<p>In the morning we found that the Vallon des Aiguilles d’Arve led away nearly due west from the Valley of Valloires, and that the village of Bonnenuit was placed (in the latter valley) almost exactly opposite to the junction of the two.</p>
			<p>At 3:55 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> on the <time datetime="1864-06-21">21st</time> we set out up the Vallon, passed for a time over pastureland, and then over a stony waste, deeply channelled by watercourses. At 5:30 the two principal Aiguilles were well seen, and as, by this time, it was evident that the authors of the Sardinian official map had romanced as extensively in this neighbourhood as elsewhere, it was necessary to hold a council.</p>

				<figcaption>The route.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Three questions were submitted to it:⁠—Firstly, Which is the highest of these Aiguilles? Secondly, Which shall we go up? Thirdly, How is it to be done?</p>
			<p>The French engineers, it was said, had determined that the two highest of them were respectively 11,513 and 11,529 feet in height; but we were without information as to which two they had measured.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-129" id="noteref-129" epub:type="noteref">129</a> Joanne indeed said (but without specifying whether he meant all three) that the Aiguilles had been several times ascended, and particularly mentioned that the one of 11,513 feet was “relatively easy.”</p>
			<p>We therefore said, “We will go up the peak of 11,529 feet.” But that determination did not settle the second question. Joanne’s “relatively easy” peak, according to his description, was evidently the most northern of the three. <em>Our</em> peak then was to be one of the other two;⁠—but which of them? We were inclined to favour the central one, though we had doubts, for they looked very equal in height. When, however, the council came to study the third question⁠—“How is it to be done?” it was unanimously voted that upon the eastern and southern sides it was certainly relatively difficult, and that a move should be made round to the northern side.</p>
			<p>The movement was duly executed, and after wading up some snow-slopes of considerable steepness (going occasionally beyond 40°), we found ourselves in a gap or nick, between the central and northernmost Aiguille, at 8:45 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> We then studied the northern face of our intended peak, and finally arrived at the conclusion that it was relatively impracticable. Croz shrugged his big shoulders, and said, “My faith! I think you will do well to leave it to others.” Almer was more explicit, and volunteered the information that a thousand francs would not tempt him to <em>try</em> it. We then turned to the northernmost peak, and found its southern faces even more hopeless than the northern faces of the central one. We enjoyed accordingly the unwonted luxury of a three hours’ rest on the top of our pass; for pass we were determined it should be.</p>

				<figcaption>The Aiguilles d’Arve from above the chalets of Rieu Blanc.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>We might have done worse. We were 10,300 or 10,400 feet above the level of the sea, and commanded a most picturesque view of the mountains of the Tarentaise; while, somewhat east of south, we saw the monarch of the Dauphiné massif, whose closer acquaintance it was our intention to make. Three sunny hours passed away, and then we turned to the descent. We saw the distant pastures of a valley (which we supposed was the Vallon or Ravine de la Sausse), and a long snow-slope leading down to them. But from that slope we were cut off by precipitous rocks, and our first impression was that we should have to return in our track. Some running about, however, discovered two little gullies, filled with threads of snow, and down the most northern of these we decided to go. It was a steep way but a safe one, for the cleft was so narrow that we could press the shoulders against one side whilst the feet were against the other, and the last remnant of the winter’s snow, well hardened, clung to the rift with great tenacity, and gave us a path when the rocks refused one. In half-an-hour we got to the top of the great snow-slope, Walker said⁠—“Let us glissade;” the guides⁠—“No, it is too steep.” Our friend, however, started off at a standing glissade and advanced for a time very skilfully; but after a while he lost his balance, and progressed downwards and backwards with great rapidity, in a way that seemed to us very much like tumbling head over heels. He let go his axe, and left it behind, but it overtook him and batted him heartily. He and it travelled in this fashion for some hundreds of feet, and at last subsided into the rocks at the bottom. In a few moments we were reassured as to his safety, by hearing him ironically request us not to keep him waiting down there.</p>
			<p>We others followed the track shown by the dotted line upon the engraving (making zigzags to avoid the little groups of rocks juttin through the snow, by which Walker had been upset), descended by a <em>sitting</em> glissade, and rejoined our friend at the bottom. We then turned sharply to the left, and tramped down the summit ridge of an old moraine of great size. Its mud was excessively hard, and where some large erratic blocks lay perched upon its crest, we were obliged to cut steps (in the mud) with our ice-axes.</p>
			<p>Guided by the sound of a distant <i>moo</i>, we speedily found the highest chalets in the valley, named Rieu Blanc. They were tenanted by three old women (who seemed to belong to one of the missing links sought by naturalists), destitute of all ideas except in regard to <em>cows</em>, and who spoke a barbarous patois, well-nigh unintelligible to the Savoyard Croz. They would not believe that we had passed between the Aiguilles⁠—“It is impossible, the <em>cows</em> never go there.” “Could we get to La Grave over yonder ridge?” “Oh yes! the <em>cows</em> often crossed!” Could they show us the way? No; but we could follow the <em>cow</em>-tracks.</p>
			<p>We stayed a while near these chalets, to examine the western sides of the Aiguilles d’Arve, and, according to our united opinion, the central one appeared as inaccessible from this direction as from the east, north, or south. On the following day we saw them again, when at a height of about 11,000 feet, from a southwesterly direction, and our opinion remained unchanged.</p>
			<p>We saw (on <time datetime="1864-06-20">June 20</time>⁠–⁠<time datetime="1864-06-22">22</time>) the central Aiguille from all sides, and very nearly completely round the southernmost one. The northern one we also saw on all sides excepting from the north. (It is, however, precisely from this direction <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">M.</abbr> Joanne says that its ascent is relatively easy.) We do not, therefore, venture to express any opinion respecting its ascent, except as regards its actual summit. This is formed of two curious prongs, or pinnacles of rock, and we do not understand in what way they (or either of them) can be ascended; nor shall we be surprised if this ascent is discovered to have been made in spirit rather than body; in fact, in the same manner as the celebrated ascent of Mont Blanc, “not quite to the summit, but as far as the Montanvert!”</p>
			<p>All three of the Aiguilles <em>may</em> be accessible, but they look as inaccessible as anything I have seen. They are the highest summits between the valleys of the Romanche and the Arc; they are placed slightly to the north of the watershed between those two valleys, and a line drawn through them runs, pretty nearly, north and south.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-130" id="noteref-130" epub:type="noteref">130</a></p>
			<p>We descended by a rough path from Rieu Blanc to the chalets of La Sausse, which give the name to the Vallon or Ravine de la Sausse, in which they are situated. This is one of the numerous branches of the valley that descends to <abbr>St.</abbr> Jean d’Arve, and subsequently to <abbr>St.</abbr> Jean de Maurienne.</p>
			<p>Two passes, more or less known, lead from this valley to the village of La Grave (on the Lautaret road) in the Valley of the Romanche, namely, the Col de l’Infernet and the Col de Martignare. The former pass was crossed in <time datetime="1841">1841</time> by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Prof.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. D.</abbr> Forbes, and was mentioned by him at <abbr>pp.</abbr> 292⁠–⁠4 of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Norway and Its Glaciers</i>. The latter one lies to the north of the former, and is seldom traversed by tourists, but it was convenient for us, and we set out to cross it on the morning of the <time datetime="1864-06-22">22nd</time>, after having passed a comfortable, though not luxurious, night in the hay, at La Sausse, where, however, the simplicity of the accommodation was more than counterbalanced by the civility and hospitality of the people in charge.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-131" id="noteref-131" epub:type="noteref">131</a></p>
			<p>[Our object now was to cross to La Grave (on the high road from Grenoble to Briançon), and to ascend, en route, some point sufficiently high to give us a good view of the Dauphiné Alps in general, and of the grand chain of the Meije in particular. Before leaving England a careful study of “Joanne” had elicited the fact that the shortest route from La Sausse to La Grave was by the Col de Martignare; and also that from the aforesaid Col it was possible to ascend a lofty summit, called by him the Bec-du-Grenier, also called Aiguille de Goléon. On referring, however, to the Sardinian survey, we found there depicted, to the east of the Col de Martignare, not one peak bearing the above <em>two</em> names, but <em>two distinct summits</em>; one⁠—just above the Col⁠—the Bec-du-Grenier (the height of which was not stated); the other, still farther to the east, and somewhat to the south of the watershed⁠—the Aiguille du Goléon (11,250 English feet in height), with a very considerable glacier⁠—the Glacier Lombard⁠—between the two. On the French map,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-132" id="noteref-132" epub:type="noteref">132</a> on the other hand, neither of the above names was to be found, but a peak called Aiguille de la Sausse (10,897 feet), was placed in the position assigned to the Bec-du-Grenier in the Sardinian map; while farther to the east was a second and nameless peak (10,841), not at all in the position given to the Aiguille du Goléon, of which and of the Glacier Lombard there was not a sign. All this was very puzzling and unsatisfactory; but as we had no doubt of being able to climb one of the points to the east of the Col de Martignare (which overhung the Ravine de la Sausse), we determined to make that col the basis of our operations.]<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-133" id="noteref-133" epub:type="noteref">133</a></p>
			<p>We left the chalets at 4:15 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> [under a shower of good wishes from our hostesses], proceeded at first towards the upper end of the ravine, then doubled back up a long buttress which projects in an unusual way, and went towards the Col de Martignare; but before arriving at its summit we again doubled, and resumed the original course. At 6 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> we stood on the watershed, and followed it towards the east; keeping for some distance strictly to the ridge, and afterwards diverging a little to the south to avoid a considerable secondary aiguille, which prevented a straight track being made to the summit at which we were aiming. At 9:15 we stood on its top, and saw at once the lay of the land.</p>
			<p>We found that our peak was one of four which enclosed a plateau that was filled by a glacier. Let us call these summits A, B, C, D (see <a href="chapter-8.xhtml#illustration-63">plan</a> earlier in this chapter). We stood upon C, which was almost exactly the same elevation as B, but was higher than D, and lower than A. Peak A was the highest of the four, and was about 200 feet higher than B and C; we identified it as the Aiguille de Goléon (French survey, 11,250 feet). Peak D we considered was the Bec-du-Grenier; and, in default of other names, we called B and C the Aiguilles de la Sausse. The glacier flowed in a southeasterly direction, and was the Glacier Lombard.</p>
			<p>Peaks B and C overhung the Ravine de la Sausse, and were connected with another aiguille⁠—E⁠—which did the same. A continuation of the ridge out of which these three aiguilles rose joined the Aiguilles d’Arve. The head of the Ravine de la Sausse was therefore encircled by six peaks; three of which it was convenient to term the Aiguilles de la Sausse, and the others were the Aiguilles d’Arve.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-134" id="noteref-134" epub:type="noteref">134</a></p>
			<p>We were fortunate in the selection of our summit. Not to speak of other things, it gave a grand view of the ridge which culminates in the peak called La Meije (13,080 feet), which used to be mentioned by travellers under the name Aiguille du Midi de la Grave. The view of this mountain from the village of La Grave itself can hardly be spoken of too highly⁠—it is one of the very finest road-views in the Alps. The Ortler Spitz from the Stelvio is, in fact, its only worthy competitor; and the opinions generally of those who have seen the two views are in favour of the former. But from La Grave one can no more appreciate the noble proportions and the towering height of the Meije, than understand the symmetry of the dome of <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul’s by gazing upon it from the churchyard. To see it fairly, one must be placed at a greater distance and at a greater height.</p>
			<p>I shall not try to describe the Meije. The same words, and the same phrases, have to do duty for one and another mountain; their repetition becomes wearisome; and ’tis a discouraging fact that any description, however true or however elaborated, seldom or never gives an idea of the reality.</p>
			<p>Yet the Meije deserves more than a passing notice. It was the last great Alpine peak to be trodden by the foot of man, and one can hardly speak in exaggerated terms of its jagged ridges, torrential glaciers, and tremendous precipices.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-135" id="noteref-135" epub:type="noteref">135</a> But were I to discourse upon these things without the aid of pictures, or to endeavour to convey in <em>words</em> a sense of the loveliness of <em>curves</em>, of the beauty of <em>colour</em>, or of the harmonies of <em>sound</em>, I should try to accomplish that which is impossible; and, at the best, should succeed in but giving an impression that the things spoken of may have been pleasant to hear or to behold, although they are perfectly incomprehensible to read about. Let me therefore avoid these things, not because I have no love for or thought of them, but because they cannot be translated into language; and presently, when topographical details must, of necessity, be returned to again, I will endeavour to relieve the poverty of the pen by a free use of the pencil.</p>
			<p>Whilst we sat upon the Aiguille de la Sausse, our attention was concentrated on a point which was immediately opposite⁠—on a gap or cleft between the Meije and the mountain called the Rateau. It was, indeed, in order to have a good view of this place that we made the ascent of the Aiguille. It (that is the gap itself) looked, as my companions remarked, obtrusively and offensively a pass. It had not been crossed, but it ought to have been; and this seemed to have been recognised by the natives, who called it, very appropriately, the Brêche de la Meije.</p>
			<p>I had seen this gap in <time datetime="1860">1860</time>, and again in <time datetime="1861">1861</time>, but had not then thought about getting through it. Our information in respect to it was chiefly derived from a photographic reproduction of the then unpublished sheet 189 of the great map of France, which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Tuckett had placed at our disposal. It was evident from this map that if we could succeed in passing the Brêche, we should make the most direct route possible between the villages of La Grave and La Bérarde, and that the distance between these two places by this route, would be less than one-third that of the ordinary way via the villages of Freney and Vénos. It may occur to some of my readers, why had not this been done before? For the very sound reason that the valley on the southern side (Vallon des Étançons) is uninhabited, and La Bérarde itself is a miserable village, without interest, without commerce, and almost without population. Why then did <em>we</em> wish to cross it? Because we were bound for the Pointe des Écrins, to which La Bérarde was the nearest inhabited place.</p>
			<p>When we sat upon the Aiguille de la Sausse, we were rather despondent about our prospects of crossing the Brêche, which seemed to present a combination of all that was formidable. There was, evidently, but one way by which it could be approached. We saw that at the top of the pass there was a steep wall of snow or ice (so steep that it was most likely ice) protected at its base by a big schrund or moat, which severed it from the snowfields below. Then (tracking our course downwards) we saw undulating snowfields leading down to a great glacier. The snowfields would be easy work, but the glacier was riven and broken in every direction; huge crevasses seemed to extend entirely across it in some places, and everywhere it had that strange twisted look, which tells of the unequal motion of the ice. Where could we get on to it? At its base it came to a violent end, being cut short by a cliff, over which it poured periodical avalanches, as we saw by a great triangular bed of debris below. We could not venture there⁠—the glacier must be taken in flank. On which side? Not on the west⁠—no one could climb those cliffs. It must, if anywhere, be by the rocks on the east; and <em>they</em> looked as if they were <i xml:lang="fr">roches moutonnées</i>.</p>
			<p>So we hurried down to La Grave, to hear what Melchior Anderegg (who had just passed through the village with the family of our friend Walker) had to say on the matter. Who is Melchior Anderegg? Those who ask the question cannot have been in Alpine Switzerland, where the name of Melchior is as well known as the name of Napoleon. Melchior, too, is an Emperor in his way⁠—a very Prince among guides. His empire is amongst the “eternal snows,”⁠—his sceptre is an ice-axe.</p>

				<figcaption>Melchior Anderegg in <time datetime="1864">1864</time>.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Melchior Anderegg, more familiarly, and perhaps more generally known simply as Melchior, was born at Zaun, near Meiringen, on <time datetime="1828-04-06">April 6, 1828</time>. He was first brought into public notice in Hinchliff’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Summer Months in the Alps</i>, and was known to very few persons at the time that little work was published. In <time datetime="1855">1855</time> he was “Boots” at the Grimsel Hotel, and in those days, when he went out on expeditions, it was for the benefit of his master, the proprietor; Melchior himself only got the <i xml:lang="de">trinkgelt</i>. In <time datetime="1856">1856</time> he migrated to the Schwarenbach Inn on the Gemmi, where he employed his time in carving objects for sale. In <time datetime="1858">1858</time> he made several expeditions with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Messrs.</abbr> Hinchliff and Stephen, and proved to his employers that he possessed first-rate skill, indomitable courage, and an admirable character. His position has never been doubtful since that year, and for a long time there has been no guide whose services have been more in request. He is usually engaged a year in advance.</p>
			<p>It would be almost an easier task to say what he has not done than to catalogue his achievements. Invariable success attends his arms. He leads his followers to victory, but not to death. I believe that no accident has ever befallen travellers in his charge. Like his friend Almer, he can be called a <em>safe</em> man. It is the highest praise that can be given to a first-rate guide.</p>
			<p>Early in the afternoon we found ourselves in the little inn at La Grave, on the great Lautaret road; a rickety, tumble-down sort of place, with nothing stable about it, as Moore wittily remarked, except the smell.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-136" id="noteref-136" epub:type="noteref">136</a> Melchior had gone, and had left behind a note which said, “I think the passage of the Brêche is possible, but that it will be very difficult.” His opinion coincided with ours, and we went to sleep, expecting to be afoot about eighteen or twenty hours on the morrow.</p>

			<p>At 2:40 the next morning we left La Grave, in a few minutes crossed the Romanche, and at 4 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> got to the moraine of the eastern branch of the glacier that descends from the Brêche.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-137" id="noteref-137" epub:type="noteref">137</a> The rocks by which we intended to ascend were placed between the two branches of this glacier, and still looked smooth and unbroken. By 5 o’clock we were upon them, and saw that we had been deluded by them. No carpenter could have planned a more convenient staircase. They were <em>not moutonnée</em>, their smooth look from a distance was only owing to their singular firmness. [It was really quite a pleasure to scale such delightful rocks. We felt the stone held the boot so well, that, without making a positive effort to do so, it would be almost impossible to slip.] In an hour we had risen above the most crevassed portion of the glacier, and began to look for a way on to it. Just at the right place there was a patch of old snow at the side, and, instead of gaining the ice by desperate acrobatic feats, we passed from the rocks on to it as easily as one walks across a gangway. At half-past 6 we were on the centre of the glacier, and the inhabitants of La Grave turned out en masse into the road, and watched us with amazement as they witnessed the falsification of their confident predictions. Well might they stare, for our little caravan, looking to them like a train of flies on a wall, crept up and up, without hesitation and without a halt⁠—lost to their sight one minute as it dived into a crevasse, then seen again clambering up the other side. The higher we rose, the easier became the work. The angles lessened, and our pace increased. The snow remained shadowed, and we walked as easily as on a high road; and when (at 7:45) the summit of the Brêche was seen, we rushed at it as furiously as if it had been a breach in the wall of a fortress, carried the moat by a dash, with a push behind and a pull before, stormed the steep slope above, and at 8:50 stood in the little gap, 11,054 feet above the level of the sea. The Brêche was won. Well might they stare; five hours and a quarter had sufficed for 6,500 feet of ascent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-138" id="noteref-138" epub:type="noteref">138</a> We screamed triumphantly as they turned in to breakfast.</p>
			<p id="chapter-8-p-43">All mountaineers know how valuable it is to study beforehand an intended route over new ground from a height at some distance. None but blunderers fail to do so, if it is possible; and one cannot do so too thoroughly. As a rule, the closer one approaches underneath a summit, the more difficult it is to pick out a path with judgment. Inferior peaks seem unduly important, subordinate ridges are exalted, and slopes conceal points beyond; and if one blindly undertakes an ascent, without having acquired a tolerable notion of the relative importance of the parts, and of their positions to one another, it will be miraculous if great difficulties are not encountered.</p>
			<p>But although the examination of an intended route from a height at a distance will tell one (who knows the meaning of the things he is looking at) a good deal, and will enable him to steer clear of many difficulties against which he might otherwise blindly run, it will seldom allow one to pronounce positively upon the practicability or impracticability of the whole of the route. No living man, for example, can pronounce positively from a distance in regard to rocks. There is an illustration of this in the case which has just been mentioned. Three of the ablest and most experienced guides concurred in thinking that the rocks we should have to pass would be found very difficult, and they presented no difficulty whatever. In truth, the sounder and less broken up are rocks, the more impracticable do they usually look from a distance; while soft and easily rent rocks, which are often amongst the most difficult and perilous to climb, very frequently look from afar as if they might be traversed by a child.</p>
			<p>It is possible to decide with greater certainty in regard to the practicability of glaciers. When one is seen to have few open crevasses (and this may be told from a great distance), then we know that it is <em>possible</em> to traverse it; but to what extent it, or a glacier that is much broken up by crevasses, will be troublesome, will depend upon the width and length of the crevasses, and upon the angles of the surface of the glacier itself. A glacier may be greatly crevassed, but the fissures may be so narrow that there is no occasion to deviate from a straight line when passing across them; or a glacier may have few open crevasses, and yet may be practically impassable on account of the steepness of the angles of its surface. Nominally, a man with an axe can go anywhere upon a glacier, but in practice it is found that to move freely upon ice one must have to deal only with small angles. It is thus necessary to know approximately the angles of the surfaces of a glacier before it is possible to determine whether it will afford easy travelling, or will be so difficult as to be (for all practical purposes) impassable. This cannot be told by looking at glaciers in full face from a distance; they must be seen in profile; and it is often desirable to examine them both from the front and in profile⁠—to do the first to study the direction of the crevasses, to note where they are most and least numerous; and the second to see whether its angles are moderate or great. Should they be very steep, it may be better to avoid them altogether, and to mount even by difficult rocks; but upon glaciers of <em>gentle</em> inclination, and with few open crevasses, better progress can always be made than upon the <em>easiest</em> rocks.</p>
			<p>So much to explain why we were deceived when looking at the Brêche de la Meije from the Aiguille de la Sausse. We took note of all the difficulties, but did not pay sufficient attention to the distance that the Brêche was south of La Grave. My meaning will be apparent from the accompanying diagram, <abbr>Fig.</abbr> 1 (constructed upon the data supplied by the French surveyors), which will also serve to illustrate how badly angles of elevation are judged by the unaided eye.</p>

				<figcaption>Angle of the summit of the Meije, as seen from La Grave.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The village of La Grave is just 5,000 feet, and the highest summit of the Meije is 13,080 feet above the level of the sea. There is therefore a difference in their levels of 8,080 feet. But the summit of the Meije is south of La Grave about 14,750 feet, and, consequently, a line drawn from La Grave to the summit of the Meije is no steeper than the dotted line drawn from A to C, Fig. 1; or, in other words, if one could go in a direct line from La Grave to the summit of the Meije the ascent would be at an angle of less than 30°. Nine persons out of ten would probably estimate the angle on the spot at double this amount.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-139" id="noteref-139" epub:type="noteref">139</a></p>
			<p>The Brêche is 2,000 feet below the summit of the Meije, and only 6,000 feet above La Grave. A direct ascent from the village to the Brêche would consequently be at an angle of not much more than 20°. But it is not possible to make the ascent as the crow flies; it has to be made by an indirect and much longer route. Our track was probably double the length of a direct line between the two places. Doubling the length halved the angles, and we therefore arrive at the somewhat amazing conclusion, that upon this, one of the steepest passes in the Alps, the mean of all the angles upon the ascent could not have been greater than 11° or 12°. Of course, in some places, the angles were much steeper, and in others less, but the <em>mean</em> of the whole could not have passed the angle above indicated.</p>
			<p>We did not trouble ourselves much with these matters when we sat on the top of the Brêche. Our day’s work was as good as over (for we knew from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Messrs.</abbr> Mathews and Bonney that there was no difficulty upon the other side), and we abandoned ourselves to ease and luxury; wondering, alternately, as we gazed upon the Rateau and the Écrins, how the one mountain could possibly hold itself together, and whether the other would hold out against <em>us</em>. The former looked [so rotten that it seemed as if a puff of wind or a clap of thunder might dash the whole fabric to pieces]; while the latter asserted itself the monarch of the group, and towered head and shoulders above all the rest of the peaks which form the great horseshoe of Dauphiné. At length a cruel rush of cold air made us shiver, and shift our quarters to a little grassy plot, 3,000 feet below⁠—an oasis in a desert⁠—where we lay nearly four hours admiring the splendid wall which protects the summit of the Meije from assault upon this side.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-140" id="noteref-140" epub:type="noteref">140</a> Then we tramped down the Vallon des Étançons, a howling wilderness, the abomination of desolation; destitute alike of animal or vegetable life; pathless, of course; suggestive of chaos, but of little else; covered almost throughout its entire length with debris from the size of a walnut up to that of a house; in a word, it looked as if half-a-dozen first-class moraines had been carted and shot into it. Our tempers were soured by constant pitfalls [it was impossible to take the eyes from the feet, and if an unlucky individual so much as blew his nose, without standing still to perform the operation, the result was either an instantaneous tumble, or a barked shin, or a half-twisted ankle. There was no end to it, and we became more savage at every step, unanimously agreeing that no power on earth would ever induce us to walk up or down this particular valley again.] It was not just to the valley, which was enclosed by noble mountains⁠—unknown, it is true, but worthy of a great reputation, and which, if placed in other districts, would be sought after, and cited as types of daring form and graceful outline.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Not so very long ago, perhaps, the Vallon des Étançons wore a more cheerful aspect. It is well known that many of the French Alpine valleys have rapidly deteriorated in quite modern times. Blanqui pointed out, a few years ago, some of the causes which have brought this about, in an address to the Academy of Sciences; and, although his remarks are not entirely applicable to this very valley, the chapter may be properly closed with some of his vigorous sentences. He said, “The abuse of the right of pasturage, and the felling of the woods, have stripped the soil of all its grass and all its trees, and the scorching sun bakes it to the consistence of porphyry. When moistened by the rain, as it has neither support nor cohesion, it rolls down into the valleys, sometimes in floods resembling black, yellow, or reddish lava, and sometimes in streams of pebbles, and even huge blocks of stone, which pour down with a frightful roar.⁠ ⁠… Vast deposits of flinty pebbles, many feet in thickness, which have rolled down and spread far over the plain, surround large trees, bury even their tops, and rise above them.⁠ ⁠… The gorges, under the influence of the sun which cracks and shivers to fragments the very rocks, and of the rain which sweeps them down, penetrate deeper and deeper into the heart of the mountain, while the beds of the torrents issuing from them are sometimes raised several feet in a single year by the debris.⁠ ⁠… An indirect proof of the increase of the evil is to be found in the depopulation of the country.⁠ ⁠… Unless prompt and energetic measures are taken, it is easy to fix the epoch when the French Alps will be but a desert.⁠ ⁠… Every year will aggravate the evil, and in half-a-century France will count more ruins, and a department the less.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-142" id="noteref-142" epub:type="noteref">142</a></p>

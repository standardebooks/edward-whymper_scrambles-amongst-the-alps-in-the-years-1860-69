Several times this number of species might be collected, I have no doubt, within these limits.

					<p>I have already had occasion to mention the rapid changes which occur in the weather at considerable elevations in the Alps, and shall have to do so again in subsequent chapters. No one can regret more than myself the variable weather which afflicts that otherwise delightful chain of mountains, or the necessity of speaking about it. Its summits appear to enjoy more than their fair share of wind and tempests. Meteorological disturbances, it would seem, are by no means necessary accompaniments of high regions. There are some happy places which are said to be favoured with almost perpetual calm. Take the case of the Sierra Nevada of California, for example, which includes numerous summits from 13,000 to 15,000 feet. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Whitney, of San Francisco, says (in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Guide-Book to the Yosemite Valley, and the Adjacent Region</i>), “At high altitudes, all through the mountains, the weather during the summer is almost always the finest possible for travelling. There are occasional storms in the high mountains; but, in ordinary seasons, these are quite rare, and one of the greatest drawbacks to the pleasure of travelling in the Alps, the uncertainty of the weather, is here almost entirely wanting.” It is probable that a more thorough acquaintance with that region will modify this opinion; for it must be admitted that it is very difficult to judge of the state of the atmosphere at great heights from the valleys, and it often occurs that a terrific storm is raging above when there is a dead calm below, at a distance perhaps of not more than three or four miles. A case of this kind is described in <a href="chapter-7.xhtml">Chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span></a>, and another may be mentioned here. At the very time that I was regarding the Dent Blanche from a height of 12,550 feet on the Matterhorn, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T. S.</abbr> Kennedy was engaged in making the first ascent of the former mountain. He described his ascent in a very picturesque paper in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Alpine Journal</i> (<time datetime="1863">1863</time>). I learn from it that he experienced severe weather. “The wind roared over our ridge, making fearfully wild music among the desolate crags.⁠ ⁠… It rendered an ordinary voice inaudible,” and “nothing at a distance greater than fifty yards could be seen at all.⁠ ⁠… Thick mists and driving clouds of snow swept over and past us;” the thermometer fell to 20° <abbr epub:type="se:temperature">F</abbr>, and his companion’s hair became a mass of white icicles. Now, at this time, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Kennedy was distant from me only four and a half miles. With me, and in my immediate neighbourhood, the air was perfectly calm, and the temperature was agreeably warm; even during the night it fell only two or three degrees below freezing-point. During most of the day the Dent Blanche was perfectly unclouded, though, for a time, light fleecy clouds were hovering about its upper 2,000 feet. Still no one would have supposed from appearances that my friend was experiencing a storm such as he has described. <a href="chapter-5.xhtml#noteref-81" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>As it seldom happens that one survives such a fall, it may be interesting to record what my sensations were during its occurrence. I was perfectly conscious of what was happening, and felt each blow; but, like a patient under chloroform, experienced no pain. Each blow was, naturally, more severe than that which preceded it, and I distinctly remember thinking “Well, if the next is harder still, that will be the end!” Like persons who have been rescued from drowning, I remember that the recollection of a multitude of things rushed through my head, many of them trivialities or absurdities, which had been forgotten long before; and, more remarkable, this bounding through space did not feel disagreeable. But I think that in no very great distance more, consciousness as well as sensation would have been lost, and upon that I base my belief, improbable as it seems, that death by a fall from a great height is as painless an end as can be experienced.</p>
					<p>The battering was very rough, yet no bones were broken. The most severe cuts were one of four inches long on the top of the head, and another of three inches on the right temple: this latter bled frightfully. There was a formidable-looking cut, of about the same size as the last, on the palm of the left hand, and every limb was grazed, or cut, more or less seriously. The tips of the ears were taken off, and a sharp rock cut a circular bit out of the side of the left boot, sock, and ankle, at one stroke. The loss of blood, although so great, did not seem to be permanently injurious. The only serious effect has been the reduction of a naturally retentive memory to a very commonplace one; and although my recollections of more distant occurrences remain unshaken, the events of that particular day would be clean gone but for the few notes which were written down before the accident. <a href="chapter-5.xhtml#noteref-85" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Down the shattered fragments came like a kind of spray, slightly wide of us, but still near enough to compel a sharp lookout.

					<p>I have entered into this matter because much surprise has been expressed that Carrel was able to pass the place without any great difficulty in <time datetime="1865">1865</time>, which turned back so strong a party in <time datetime="1862">1862</time>. The cause of Professor Tyndall’s defeat was simply that his second guide (Walter) did not give aid to Bennen when it was required, and that the Carrels <em>would not act as guides after having been hired as porters</em>. <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.-A.</abbr> Carrel not only knew of the existence of this place before they came to it; but always believed in the possibility of passing it, and of ascending the mountain; and had he been leader to the party I do not doubt that he might have taken Tyndall to the top.

					<p>The summit of the Théodule pass is 10,899 feet above the sea. It is estimated that of late about a thousand tourists have crossed it per annum. In the winter, when the crevasses are bridged over and partially filled up, and the weather is favourable, cows and sheep can still pass over it from Zermatt to Val Tournanche, and vice versa.</p>
					<p>In the <em>middle of <time datetime="1792-08">August</time></em>, 1792, De Saussure appears to have taken mules from Breuil, over the Val Tournanche Glacier to the summit of the Théodule; and on a previous journey he did the same, also in the middle of August. He distinctly mentions (§ 2220) that the glacier was completely covered with snow, and that <em>no</em> crevasses were open. Of late years, the glacier has usually been very bare of snow in the month of August, and has had many open crevasses.</p>
					<p>Since <time datetime="1855">1855</time>, or thereabouts, Zermatt has become one of the most popular Alpine resorts, and it is still growing in favour. Fifty years ago, the Théodule pass, the Weissthor, and the Col d’Hérens were, I believe, the only routes taken from this place across the Pennine Alps. At the present time there are more than two dozen ways by which a tourist may arrive or depart. The summits of some of the Cols are more than 14,000 feet above the sea.</p>

The first of these two streams filled the sea with ice to such an extent that even from the highest mountains it was impossible to see open water till it was broken up by the action of the waves. It then drifted westward as far as Reykjanes, and up into the rivers along the coast, so that large icebergs were left standing in the bed of the river in the Ölfusá. The greater portion, however, of the ice that had been washed down from the glacier remained fixed aground at a distance of about seven miles from land, in a hundred fathoms water. It formed, moreover, a high ridge over the land from the sea as far as Hafrsey, a fjeld on Myrdalssandr.⁠ ⁠… A stream of similar terrific character broke out on the following day, and submerged the masses of ice that had been previously discharged into the sea, as far as the eye could reach. Further, it made its way through Kerlingar Valley, and dammed up the stream there. The deluge, or, more properly speaking, the ice, carried, moreover, immense masses of rock with it; and in the vicinity of Hjörleifshöfdi, a mountain on Myrdalssandr, a rock of twenty fathoms in height, entirely disappeared; not to speak of other instances. One can form some idea of the altitude of this barrier of ice, when it is mentioned that from Höfdabrekka farm, which lies high up on a fjeld of the same name, one could not see Hjörleifshöfdi opposite, which is a fell 640 feet in height; but in order to do so, had to clamber up a mountain slope east of Höfdabrekka, 1,200 feet high. The distance between Höfdabrekka and Hjörleifshöfdi is one (Danish) geographical mile, or the fifteenth part of a degree.” <a href="chapter-6.xhtml#noteref-106" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The summit of the Col de Valpelline is about 11,650 feet above the sea.

					<p>In <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#chapter-1-p-17">Chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span></a> it is stated that there was not a pass from Prerayen to Breuil in <time datetime="1860">1860</time>, and this is correct. On <time datetime="1868-07-08">July 8, 1868</time>, my enterprising guide, Jean-Antoine Carrel, started from Breuil at 2 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> with a well-known comrade⁠—<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Baptiste Bich, of Val Tournanche⁠—to endeavour to make one. They went towards the glacier which descends from the Dent d’Hérens to the southeast, and on arriving at its base, ascended at first by some snow between it and the cliffs on its south, and afterwards took to the cliffs themselves. This glacier they called the glacier of Mont Albert, after the local name of the peak which on <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Reilly’s map of the Valpelline is called “Les Jumeaux.” On <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Reilly’s map the glacier is called “Glacier d’Erin.” They ascended the rocks to a considerable height, and then struck across the glacier, towards the north, to a small “rognon” (isolated patch of rocks) that is nearly in the centre of the glacier. They passed above this, and between it and the great seracs. Afterwards their route led them towards the Dent d’Hérens, and they arrived at the base of its final peak by mounting a couloir (gully filled with snow), and the rocks at the head of the glacier. They gained the summit of their pass at 1 <abbr>p.m.</abbr>, and, descending by the glacier of Za-de-Zan, arrived at Prerayen at 6:30 <abbr class="eoc">p.m.</abbr></p>

Carrel considers that the route taken by himself and his comrade Bich can be improved upon; and, if so, it is possible that the ascent of the Dent d’Hérens can be made from Breuil in less time than from Prerayen. Breuil is very much to be preferred as a starting-point.

					<p>It was an entry describing an ascent of the Grand Cornier (which we supposed had never been ascended) from the very direction which we had just pronounced to be hopeless! It was especially startling, because Franz Biener was spoken of in the account as having been concerned in the ascent. On examining Biener it was found that he had made the excursion, and had supposed at the time he was upon his summit that it was the Grand Cornier. He saw afterwards that they had only ascended one of the several points upon the ridge running northwards from the Grand Cornier⁠—I believe, the Pigne de l’Allée (11,168 feet)!</p>

In the former work an account is given of the discovery of the remains of a knapsack ten years after it had been dropped in a crevasse, at a horizontal distance of 4,300 feet from the place at which it had been lost, showing an average annual motion of 430 feet. In the latter work there is a relation of the recovery of the remains of a ladder used by De Saussure, which had travelled about 13,000 feet in 44 years, or 295 feet per annum. Forbes says that the first of these two examples is better ascertained in all its particulars than the other. It should be observed that the knapsack in question made the descent of the well-known “icefall” of the Glacier de Talèfre, and that there was a difference of level between the place at which it was lost and that at which it was found of 1,145 feet; that is to say, it descended one foot in every four that it advanced. This rapid descent undoubtedly accelerates the motion of the Glacier de Talèfre. The town of Ivrea, on the other hand, is 768 feet (Ball) above the level of the sea, while Entrèves (at the foot of Mont Blanc) is 4,216 feet (Mieulet). So that the glacier which once spread over the sites of these two places (which are about 65 miles apart) descended by an average gradient of almost exactly 1 in 100. This moderate rate of inclination would as certainly tend to retard the motion of the glacier. <a href="chapter-16.xhtml#noteref-262" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The late Principal <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. D.</abbr> Forbes was the first to attach any importance to the veined structure of glaciers. I gather the following definitions of it from different pages of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Occasional Papers</i>. “I cannot more accurately describe it, than by calling it a <em>ribboned structure</em>, formed by thin and delicate blue and bluish-white bands or strata, which appear to traverse the ice in a vertical direction, or rather which, by their apposition, formed the entire mass of the ice. The direction of these bands was parallel to the length of the glacier” (<abbr>p.</abbr> 3). “In some parts of the glacier it appears more developed than in others.⁠ ⁠… It penetrates the <em>thickness</em> of the glacier to great depths. It is an integral part of its inmost structure” (<abbr>p.</abbr> 5). “The breadth of these (bands) varies from a small fraction of an inch to several inches” (<abbr>p.</abbr> 8). “This structure consists in the alternation of more or less perfectly crystallised ice in parallel layers, often thinning out altogether like veins in marble” (<abbr>p.</abbr> 19).</p>
					<p>Forbes’ “veined structure” is frequently cut, both horizontally and vertically, by other veins, which latter seem to me to have clearly a different origin from the former. Proper discrimination has not hitherto been made between the two. Observers sometimes call one, sometimes the other, and sometimes both, the “veined structure.” It would, I think, be convenient and appropriate to term Forbes’ structure “the laminated structure of glacier.” In <time datetime="1867">1867</time>, upon the surface of a glacier in the Jakobshavn district, North Greenland, I saw three series of veins crossing each other in three different directions, forming a crossbar or network pattern upon the ice.

The best plan I know is that which we adopted on the descent of the Col Dolent, namely, to let one man go in advance until he reaches some secure point. This one then detaches himself, the rope is drawn up, and another man is sent down to join him, and so on until the last. The last man still occupies the most difficult post, and should be the steadiest man; but he is not exposed to any risk from his comrades slipping, and they, of course, draw in the rope as he descends, so that his position is less hazardous than if he were to come down quite by himself. <a href="chapter-20.xhtml#noteref-346" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>I remember speaking about pedestrianism to a well-known mountaineer some years ago, and venturing to remark that a man who averaged thirty miles a-day might be considered a good walker. “A fair walker,” he said, “a <em>fair</em> walker.” “What then would you consider <em>good</em> walking?” “Well,” he replied, “I will tell you. Some time back a friend and I agreed to go to Switzerland, but a short time afterwards he wrote to say he ought to let me know that a young and delicate lad was going with him who would not be equal to great things, in fact, he would not be able to do more than fifty miles a-day!” “What became of the young and delicate lad?” “He lives.” “And who was your extraordinary friend?” “Charles Hudson.” I have every reason to believe that the gentlemen referred to <em>were</em> equal to walking more than fifty miles a-day, but they were exceptional, not <em>good</em> pedestrians.</p>
					<p>Charles Hudson, Vicar of Skillington in Lincolnshire, was considered by the mountaineering fraternity to be the best amateur of his time. He was the organiser and leader of the party of Englishmen who ascended Mont Blanc by the <abbr>Aig.</abbr> du Goûter, and descended by the Grands Mulets route, without guides, in <time datetime="1855">1855</time>. His long practice made him surefooted, and in that respect he was not greatly inferior to a born mountaineer. I remember him as a well-made man of middle height and age, neither stout nor thin, with face pleasant⁠—though grave, and with quiet unassuming manners. Although an athletic man, he would have been overlooked in a crowd; and although he had done some of the greatest mountaineering feats which have been done, he was the last man to speak of his own doings. His friend <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hadow was a young man of nineteen, who had the looks and manners of a greater age. He was a rapid walker, but <time datetime="1865">1865</time> was his first season in the Alps. Lord Francis Douglas was about the same age as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hadow. He had had the advantage of several seasons in the Alps. He was nimble as a deer, and was becoming an expert mountaineer. Just before our meeting he had ascended the Ober Gabelhorn (with old Peter Taugwalder and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Jos.</abbr> Viennin), and this gave me a high opinion of his powers; for I had examined that mountain all round, a few weeks before, and had declined its ascent on account of its apparent difficulty.</p>
					<p>My personal acquaintance with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hudson was very slight⁠—still I should have been content to have placed myself under his orders if he had chosen to claim the position to which he was entitled. Those who knew him will not be surprised to learn that, so far from doing this, he lost no opportunity of consulting the wishes and opinions of those around him. We deliberated together whenever there was occasion, and our authority was recognised by the others. Whatever responsibility there was devolved upon us. I recollect with satisfaction that there was no difference of opinion between us as to what should be done, and that the most perfect harmony existed between all of us so long as we were together. <a href="chapter-21.xhtml#noteref-357" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Both are jagged, serrated ridges, which any experienced climber would willingly avoid if he could find another route. On the northern (Zermatt) side the eastern face affords another route, or any number of routes, since there is hardly a part of it which cannot be traversed! On the southern (Breuil) side the ridge alone, generally speaking, can be followed; and when it becomes impracticable, and the climber is forced to bear down to the right or to the left, the work is generally of the most difficult character. <a href="chapter-21.xhtml#noteref-363" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Very few stones fell during the two days I was on the mountain, and none came near us. Others who have followed the same route have not been so fortunate; they may not, perhaps, have taken the same precautions. It is a noteworthy fact, that the lateral moraine of the left bank of the Furgggletscher is scarcely larger than that of the right bank, although the former receives all the debris that falls from the 4,000 feet of cliffs which form the eastern side of the Matterhorn, whilst the latter is fed by perfectly insignificant slopes. Neither of these moraines is large. This is strong evidence that stones do <em>not</em> fall to any great extent from the eastern face. The inward dip of the beds retains the detritus in place. Hence the eastern face appears, when one is upon it, to be undergoing more rapid disintegration than the other sides: in reality, the mantle of ruin spares the mountain from farther waste. Upon the southern side, rocks fall as they are rent off; “each day’s work is cleared away” every day; and hence the faces and ridges are left naked, and are exposed to fresh attacks. <a href="chapter-21.xhtml#noteref-364" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Signor Giordano was naturally disappointed at the result, and wished the men to start again. <em>They all refused to do so, with the exception of Jean-Antoine.</em> Upon the <time datetime="1865-07-16">16th of July</time> he set out again with three others, and upon the <time datetime="1865-07-17">17th</time> gained the summit by passing (at first) up the southwest ridge, and (afterwards) by turning over to the Z’Mutt, or northwestern side. On the <time datetime="1865-07-18">18th</time> he returned to Breuil.</p>
					<p>Whilst we were upon the southern end of the summit-ridge, we paid some attention to the portion of the mountain which intervened between ourselves and the Italian guides. It seemed as if there would not be the least chance for them if they should attempt to storm the final peak directly from the end of the “shoulder.” In that direction cliffs fell sheer down from the summit, and we were unable to see beyond a certain distance. There remained the route about which Carrel and I had often talked, namely, to ascend directly at first from the end of the “shoulder,” and afterwards to swerve to the left⁠—that is, to the Z’Mutt side⁠—and to complete the ascent from the northwest. When we were upon the summit we laughed at this idea. The part of the mountain that I have described <a href="chapter-21.xhtml#chapter-21-p-8">earlier in this chapter</a> was not easy, although its inclination was moderate. If that slope were made only ten degrees steeper, its difficulty would be greatly increased. To double its inclination would be to make it impracticable. The slope at the southern end of the summit-ridge, falling towards the northwest, was <em>much</em> steeper than that over which we passed, and we ridiculed the idea that any person should attempt to ascend in that direction, when the northern route was so easy. Nevertheless, the summit was reached by that route by the undaunted Carrel. From knowing the final slope over which he passed, and from the account of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">F. C.</abbr> Grove⁠—who is the only traveller by whom it has been traversed⁠—I do not hesitate to term the ascent of Carrel and Bich in <time datetime="1865">1865</time> the most desperate piece of mountain-scrambling upon record. In <time datetime="1869">1869</time> I asked Carrel if he had ever done anything more difficult.

Notwithstanding repeated denials, even his comrades and neighbours at Zermatt persisted in asserting or insinuating that he <em>cut</em> the rope which led from him to Lord Francis Douglas. In regard to this infamous charge, I say that he <em>could</em> not do so at the moment of the slip, and that the end of the rope in my possession shows that he did not do so beforehand. There remains, however, the suspicious fact that the rope which broke was the thinnest and weakest one that we had. It is suspicious, because it is unlikely that any of the four men in front would have selected an old and weak rope when there was abundance of new, and much stronger, rope to spare; and, on the other hand, because if Taugwalder thought that an accident was likely to happen, it was to his interest to have the weaker rope where it was placed.</p>
					<p>I should rejoice to learn that his answers to the questions which were put to him were satisfactory. Not only was his act at the critical moment wonderful as a feat of strength, but it was admirable in its performance at the right time. He left Zermatt, and lived for several years in retirement in the United States; but ultimately returned to his native valley, and died suddenly on <time datetime="1888-07-11">July 11, 1888</time>, at the Lac Noir (Schwarzsee). <a href="chapter-22.xhtml#noteref-390" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

The adoption of a route by which the nearest succour was (at the pace of the party) 19½ instead of 8 hours off, may have been simply a deplorable error of judgment; but the determination to leave the sick man alone showed unpardonable want of heart. It must ever be a matter of profound regret that any travellers or guides should, without the least pressure of necessity, have left a sick man, without firewood in a hut 13,000 feet above the sea, to over thirty hours of certain and absolute solitude. There can be no doubt that the desertion of Brantschen under such circumstances was a flagrant breach of the first tradition of all honourable mountaineering⁠—the tradition, by virtue of which every member of a party, guide or mountaineer, has been accustomed in danger or distress to count on the support of his comrades.” <a href="appendix-c.xhtml#noteref-415" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
